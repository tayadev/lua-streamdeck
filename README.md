# Lua Streamdeck

A lua library for directly interfacing with the Elgato Streamdeck via HID

# TODO
- better selection/creation of device
- fix sumneko or me being confused about classes
- flip images
- SD+
- close hid device properly on garbage collection
- then make actual usable interface over the pure hw commands
